# Git Basics

This repository will help you get comfortable with basic git operations: making changes and publishing them.

We will learn the following git operations:

- `add` changes to the staging area
- `commit` changes
- `push` local commits to publish them to GitHub
- `pull` changes from the remote repository

Other useful commands to see what is going on the git repository:

- `status`
- `log`

## Exercises

- [ ] Fork this repo
- [ ] Clone this repo
- [ ] Update the README: add some lines to the end and push them to GitHub
- [ ] Create a new file called `newfile.txt`, add some contents to it and push it to GitHub
- [ ] Update newfile.txt and push the changes to GitHub
- [ ] Open the repository on GitHub and make changes to `newfile.txt`
- [ ] Pull the changes to your local repository

## Discuss

What is the difference between `add`, `commit`, and `push`?

`ADD` transfers the file with changes to the staging area.
`COMMIT` transfers the file from staging to the Master branch of the local repository.
`PUSH` syncs the local repository with the remote repository, provided the local repo is up to date on the changes in the remote repo.
